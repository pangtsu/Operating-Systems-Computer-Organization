# Operating Systems & Computer Organization
## Operating Systems
The class covered topics include I/O programming, concurrent processes and synchronization problems, process management and scheduling of processes, virtual memory management, device management, file systems, deadlock problems, system calls, and interprocess communication. 
- Some of the projects I've done include CPU Scheduler using First Come First Served, Shortest Job First, Shortest Remaining Time and Round Robin algorithms, Basic Interactive Bash Shell, Multithreaded Knightâ€™s Tour Solver, and Multithreaded Chat Server using Socket Programming. 
- All programming projects are written in C.

## Computer Organization	
The class covered introduction to computer organization, assembler language, and operating systems. Computer systems organization: processors, memory, I/O. Digital logic: gates, Boolean algebra, digital logic circuits, memory, buses. Microprogramming. Machine level: instruction formats, addressing modes, instruction types, flow of control. 
Operating systems: virtual memory, virtual I/O instructions, processes, interprocess communication. Numeric representation. Assembler language: the assembly process, macros, linking, loading. Advanced architectures: RISC architectures, parallel architectures.

- Some of the projects I've done include basic C to MIPS Converter and Pipeline Simulation.
